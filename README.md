All data and code for the paper sharing said name 
Data set: Contains the random numbers generated by RNGs

2D_walk_test: Shows the randomness testing algorithm created 

QRNG_plotting: Shows the complexity data visualization 

PRNG: contains all code used for dataset generation Should work in java 

QRNG: contains code used for QRNG tests and data generation, however the code requires quantique package manager being available on the user's system and installation of the java wrapper 

Disclaimer: This work is not created to impede on the quantis library hence the removal of certain key aspects that affect dependency injection for java.
